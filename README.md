#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me develop the basics of design which I previously had no experience with. Before this project I didnt know anything about graphic design and now I feel I can at least set up a simple scene with objects, a camera, textures, and lighting.

#What design process did you follow for your project work?
My proces started with setting up the programming environment by including all the libraries I would need to accomplish the project. I then started work on the objects by creating the window and functions to render objects according to their vertices data. Next I developed a camera and added navigation to the scene so that I could move throughout the world and view objects from different angles. I then moved on to add texture to the objects so that they looked more realistic. Lastly I added light objects and used the phong lighting model to represent ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting

#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
all of the skills I developed within this course will be a huge asset in design centered careers such as the gaming industry and also highly valuable in other areas such as UX/UI design. These skills will be the foundation that I build upon in the future to become more well versed and proficient at graphic design techniques.

#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used many development stategies for working with my 3D scene but I believe the most important was using modular programming due to the complexity and amount of code used to render a scene. One new strategy that I was introduced to was using loops to develop circular objects which reduced the amount of code for vertices data. Another new strategy that I learned was mapping textures to objects using a coordinate system.

#How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was used extensively in my development of the program. One way which was described above was to use iteration in developing circular objects thus reducing the amount of vertices information to render the object. Another example is the while loop which creates and updates the window until the escape button is pressed.

#How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
One way my approach evolved was to incorporate more modularized code due the added complexity and amount of code with every object added to the scene. Another way it has evolved was to reuse code as much as possible and use clear comments when describing the codes functionality to keep the program maintainable.

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
computational graphics and visualizations give me the ability to create objects, scenes, and entire worlds that can be explored in a 3D perspective. In the future I can build upon this to learn ray tracing and other abilities to portray a lifelike scene. I feel as if the knowledge I have gained is only the foundation upon which I can build a sound and sturdy structure.

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This is great for gaming or creating visual representations such as in augmented reality or when developing prototypes. Overall I can use this new knowledge for many different career fields and build upon that knowledge in the future to advance my career. For example I may be able to enter the medical field by rendering 3D graphics of a patients internal organs which surgeons can navigate and best decide how to approach a complicated and life threatening surgery.
